# gitify
getting git set up for workflow and project management

## Sources 

Using these sources for making this a more regular part of my workflow.

* https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html has some great R focussed advice including step by steps
* https://openscapes.github.io/series/github-pub.html has some incomplete instructions and rationale and pholosophy
    * "Lab" culture
    * Code of conduct advice
    * other indoctrination
    
## Testing issues for project management
      
I am particularly interested in using Issues to see what they can do.

## Steps for starting a new gitified project

### 1.  Starting with GitHub repo

1. Create new repo on GitHub with README.md or .Rmd for R projects

2. Copy https path

3. In git bash window navigate to where you want repo and type 

* `git clone https://pathcopied_from_GitHub/reponame`
