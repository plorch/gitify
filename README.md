getting git set up for workflow and project management

## Sources 

Using these sources for making this a more regular part of my workflow.

* https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html has some great R focussed advice including step by steps
* https://openscapes.github.io/series/github-pub.html has some incomplete instructions and rationale and pholosophy
    * "Lab" culture
    * Code of conduct advice
    * other indoctrination
